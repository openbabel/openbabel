   * @class OBStereo stereo.h <openbabel/stereo/stereo.h>
   * @brief Placeholder for enums & Ref/Refs related functions.
   *
   * The OBStereo struct contains a number of enums with predefined values.
   * These are OBStereo::BondDirection, OBStereo::Type, OBStereo::Shape,
   * OBStereo::View, OBStereo::Winding. There are enums
   * which only apply to certain types of stereochemistry but having them
   * in 1 place makes it easier to remember.
   *
   * The OBStereo struct also contains typedefs and functions which
   * are crucial to fully understand how to use the OBStereoBase derived
   * classes (i.e. OBTetrahedralStereo, OBCisTransStereo, ...). Ref variables
   * and Refs lists are a way to uniquely reference atoms in the molecule. In
   * most cases these Ref variables are the same as the unique atom ids
   * (OBAtom::GetId). However, 2 special cases are provided:
   *
   * - OBStereo::NoRef: An initial value for Ref variables. The constructors of
   *   the various Config structs set all refs to NoRef (Refs lists will remain
   *   empty). This value is considered invalid when comparing stereochemistry.
   * - OBStereo::ImplicitRef: Can be used to replace implicit hydrogen ids.
   *   Even with explicit hydrogens, it is still valid to replace the Ref of
   *   the hydrogen with ImplicitRef. This flexibility also applies to
   *   comparing stereochemistry. It is possible to compare stereochemistry
   *   (e.g. OBTetrahedral::Config::operator==) between a Config struct with
   *   an ImplicitRef and a Config struct where the Ref is the atom id of the
   *   explicit hydrogen. See actual documentation for details about operator==.
   *
   * There are utility functions which make it easier to handle Refs. The most
   * frequently used one is OBStereo::MakeRefs to create lists containing 3 or
   * 4 Ref values. Formats and library use normally doesn't need the other
   * functions.

   * The sign of \f$S_v\f$ changes when any of the points cross the plane defined

   * In case there are only 3 neighbor atoms for the tetrahedral center, the

   *

   * - must be a double bond
   * - must not be in a ring
   * - both begin and end atom should have at least one single bond
   *
   * True stereocenters (i.e. stereocenters with topologically different
   * ligands) are identified first. For tetrahedral stereocenters, true
   * stereocenters will have 4 different neighbor atom symmetry classes
   * and this can be expressed using T1234 to classify these stereocenters.
   * For stereogenic bonds, a similar classification C12 can be used but
   * both begin and end atom have their own classification and the bond
   * is only a true stereocenter if both atoms are C12.
   *
   * Para stereocenters are all stereocenters where there are at least two
   * equivalent neighbor atom symmetry classes. These are T1123, T1112, T1111
   * and T1122 for tetrahedral stereocenters and C11 for double bonds. To
   * determine which of the remaining potential stereocenters really are
   * stereocenters, a set of rules is used.<sup>1</sup>
   *
   * Rule 1 is applied recusively:
   *
   * All rings are merged "mergedRings". A merged ring is simply a fragment consisting
   * of all atoms of a ring system (bridged, spiro, adjacent, ...). If two rings in the
   * SSSR set share an atom, they are merged.
   *
   * Each merged must at least have two para-stereocenters (or 1 true + 1 para) in order
   * for the para-stereocenter to be valid. This is repeated until no new stereocenters
   * are identified.
   *
   * rule 1a for double bonds:
   * - bond atom in ring has two identical symmetry classes for it's neighbor atoms (-> para)
   * - other bond atom:
   *   - has two different symmetry classes for it's neighbours -> new stereocenter
   *   - has two identical symmetry classes, but the ligand contains at least 1 true or para stereocenter -> new stereocenter
   *
   * rule 1b for tetracoord atoms:
   * - at least two neighbour symmetry classes are the same (-> para)
   * - other pair:
   *   - has two different symmetry classes for it's neighbours -> new stereocenter
   *   - has two identical symmetry classes, but the ligand contains at least 1 true or para stereocenter -> new stereocenter
   *
   * Rules 2 and 3 are applied sequential (i.e. only once).
   *
   * Rule 2a for tetracoordinate carbon:
   * - 1 or 2 pair identical ligands
   * - each ligand contains at least 1 true-stereocenter or 2 para-stereocenters (from rule 1)
   *
   * Rule 2b for tetracoordinate carbon:
   * - 3 or 4 identical ligands with at least
   *   - 2 true-stereocenters
   *   - 2 separate assemblies of para-stereocenters (from rule 1)

   *

   *
   * - must be a double bond
   * - must not be in a ring
   * - both begin and end atom should have at least one single bond
   *
   * Once the potential stereocenters are found, the automorphisms are the key
   * to identifying real stereogenic units. Automorphisms can be seen as
   * permutations that permutate a graph back to the same graph. Such a
   * permutation can only exchange atoms with the same symmetry class and it
   * follows that the use of automorphisms takes symmetry into account. The
   * definitions below use a concept where the automorphisms cause inversions
   * of configuration to potential stereocenters. Such an inversion occurs
   * whenever an automorphism exchanges two equivalent (i.e. with the same
   * symmetry class) neighbor atoms attached to the potential stereogenic unit.
   *
   * @par Definition for tetrahedral stereocenters:
   * A potential stereocenter really is a stereocenter if there exists no automorphic
   * permutation causing an inversion of the configuration of only the potential
   * stereogenic unit under consideration.
   * If there exists at least one automorphic permutation causing an inversion of
   * the configuration, then the potential stereogenic center can be a stereogenic
   * center if the number of topologically equivalent neighbors (ligands) of the
   * potential stereogenic center is less than or equal to the number of different
   * configurations of these ligands.<sup>1</sup>
   *
   * The actual number of configurations needed for the ligands depends on the
   * classification (i.e. T1234, T1123, ...) of the stereo center. These classes
   * reflect the symmetry classes of the neighbor atoms of the center.
   *
   * - T1123: 1 true stereocenter OR 2 para stereocenters
   * - T1122: 1 true stereocenter OR 2 para stereocenters (for both)
   * - T1112: 2 true stereocenters OR 2 para stereocenter assemblies
   * - T1111: 2 true stereocenters OR 2 para stereocenter assemblies
   *
   * @par Definition for double bond stereocenters:
   * A potential stereogenic double bond really is a stereogenic bond if there
   * exists no automorphic permutation causing an inversion of the configuration
   * of only the potential stereogenic unit under consideration. The bond can still
   * be a stereogenic bond if there exists such an automorphism when the number of
   * configurations of the pair of topologically equivalent geminal ligands, which
   * are exchanged by the automorphism, is greater than or equal to two (i.e. the
   * number of topologically equivalent geminal ligands.<sup>1</sup>
   *
   * For stereogenic bonds, there is only one case but both begin and end atom
   * have to be checked.
   *
   * - C11: 1 true stereocenter OR 1 para stereocenter
   *
   * These criteria are analogous to the rules from the Razinger paper on
   * stereoisomer generation. Since the existence of stereocenters can depend
   * on the existence of other stereocenters (in the ligands), the stereocenters
   * are found by iterating until no new stereocenters are found.

   * @section overview Overview of classes
   *
   * There are many molecules which contain stereogenic elements. However,
   * certain cases (i.e. tetrahedral, cis/trans) are more common than others
   * (i.e. allene, biphenyl, octrahedral, ...). For the common stereogenic
   * units, classes are provided. The inheritance of these classes resembles
   * the way they are split into groups.
   *
   * - OBStereoBase
   *   - OBTetraNonPlanarStereo
   *     - OBTetrahedralStereo
   *     - OBExtendedTetrahedralStereo

   *     - OBOctahedralStereo
   *
   * @image html tetranonplanar.png
   * @image html tetraplanar.png
   *
   * All specific classes (i.e. OBTetrahedralStereo, ...) have embedded Config
   * structs which define the actual stereochemistry. All these Config structs
   * use OBStereo::Ref values to reference or uniquely identify atoms. Make sure
   * to read about OBStereo::Ref and the related functions (in OBStereo). OBStereo
   * is also a placeholder for various enums with predefined values for parameters
   * etc. These enums are used throughout the different stereo classes but having
   * these enums in a single location makes it easier to remember. When working
   * with stereo classes, you normally don't need to use any of the parent classes
   * directly. Only OBStereo and the specific class are needed.
   *
   * @section usage Basic usage
   *
   * The OBStereoFacade hides the complexity of working with stereochemistry. When
   * using openbabel as a library, this is by far the easiest way to access
   * stereochemistry information.
   * The header for the specific OBStereo::Type type is all you need to include.
   * These are:
   * - @em openbabel/stereo/tetrahedral.h
   * - @em openbabel/stereo/cistrans.h
   * - @em openbabel/stereo/squareplanar.h
   *
   * All these headers also include @em openbabel/stereo/stereo.h providing
   * declarations for OBStereo & OBStereoFacade.
   *
     @code
     #include <iostream>

   * All specific stereo classes and their embedded Config struct have an
   * operator<< function which allows them to be used with std::ostream objects
   * (e.g. std::cout, std::err, ...). These functions are often useful when
   * debugging code.
   *
   * @section details Details on implementation
   *
   * The detection of stereogenic units start with symmetry analysis. However, a
   * complete symmetry analysis also needs to take stereochemistry into account.
   * In practice, this means stereochemistry will be found iteratively. At each
   * iteration, the current atom symmetry classes are used to identify stereogenic
   * units. The details about how the symmetry classes are used depends on the type
   * (OBStereo::Type) of stereogenic unit. For tetrahedral centers, having 3 heavy
   * atom neighbors with different symmetry classes or 4 neighbors with different
   * symmetry classes means the atom is chiral. See FindStereogenicUnits() for
   * details.
   *
   * After identifying the stereogenic units, Config structs with all the
   * information on the spacial arrangement of the groups still have to be
   * created. This involves interpreting various ways to represent
   * stereochemisrty:
   *
   * - 3D coordinates: StereoFrom3D()
   * - 2D coordinates: StereoFrom2D()
   * - 0D coordinates: StereoFrom0D()
   *
   * Both StereoFrom3D() and StereoFrom2D() delete all existing stereochemistry objects
   * before adding new ones. For molecules with 3D coordinates, it is evident that
   * all information is specified by the coordinates itself. However, if a file format
   * uses stereo parity flags, Config structs must be constructed using lower level
   * functions and StereoFrom3D() should not be called. In these cases information
   * could be lost by calling StereoFrom3D() after reading the file (the stereo flag might have
   * indicated the stereochemistry was unspecified or the flag might not match the
   * coordinates). In the case of 2D molecules, the coordinates together with bond
   * properties (OBBond::Hash, OBBond::Wedge, OBBond::WedgeOrHash and
   * OBBond::CisOrTrans) define the stereochemistry. Again, lower level functions
   * can be used when stereo flags need to be used.
   *
   * StereoFrom0D() works slightly different than 3D/2D. Here, deleting the
   * stereochemistry would always result in lost information. Instead StereoFrom0D()
   * only adds new objects for stereogenic units which were previously not found.
   * For example, a smiles is read which has two tetrahedral centers. Only one has
   * stereochemistry specified using a '@' character. StereoFrom0D() will detect the
   * second tetrahedral atom and add an OBTetrahedralStereo object to the molecule.
   * The Config::specified flag for the newly added structs is always set to false.
   *
   * Assuming the format code has correctly set the molecule dimensions (OBMol::GetDimesions),
   * PerceiveStereo() will automatically select the correct function to call.
   * When StereoFrom3D(), StereoFrom2D() or StereoFrom0D() are not used, make sure to always
   * set OBMol::HasChiralityPerceived() before returning from the format's ReadMolecule().

   * @section formats Guidelines for formats
   * @subsection input Reading files
   *
   * - Read the section above
   * - The MDL format (mdlformat.cpp) is a good example for 2D/3D formats with or
   *   without parity flags.
   * - The SMILES format (smilesformat.cpp) is a good example for 0D formats.
   *
   * @subsection output Writing files
   *
   * For many file formats no additional code is needed. For example, if a 3D format
   * doesn't require stereo parity flags, writing the coordinates is enough. For 2D
   * file formats it will often suffice to write the coordinates and bond properties.
   * If parity flags are needed, the OBStereoFacade class can be used to retrieve the
   * objects for all types of stereochemistry supported by the file format.
