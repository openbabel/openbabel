Chemistry::OpenBabel version 1.4
================================

This module provides a Perl interface to the Open Babel chemistry library. 

Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages
of chemical data. It's an open, collaborative project allowing anyone
to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling,
chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas.

The code is generated using the SWIG package and provides access to
almost all of the Open Babel interfaces via Perl, including the base
classes OBMol, OBAtom, OBBond, and OBResidue, as well as the
conversion framework OBConversion, fingerprints, and force field optimization
using the open source Ghemical molecular mechanics method.

The version numbering does not always correspond to any particular release of
Open Babel. For more information on the releases of Chemistry::OpenBabel, see
the Changes file.

Future development will include a "glue module" to integrate with
PerlMol and other Perl chemistry projects.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, type the following (assuming you have already
installed Open Babel):
