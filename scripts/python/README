OpenBabel Python bindings version 1.5
=====================================

This is a Python interface to the Open Babel chemistry library. 

Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages
of chemical data. It's an open, collaborative project allowing anyone
to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling,
chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas.

The wrapper is generated using the SWIG package and provides access to
almost all of the Open Babel interfaces via Python, including the base
classes OBMol, OBAtom, OBBond, and OBResidue, as well as the
conversion framework OBConversion.

To install this module, type the following (assuming you have already
installed Open Babel):

     openbabel-2.2.2 or a more recent version.

Note that if you are trying to build/run this Python code in the Open
Babel source/build directory BEFORE you install Open Babel, you may
encounter problems if the Python module is linked against an older

this module, make sure you have run "make install" for the latest
Open Babel package and THEN rebuild this Python module.
