Scala has native support for Java libraries. First compile Java bindings and
then you can use them in Scala programs.

There is a small test program OBTest.scala. Provided that Java bindings are
installed in OB_JAVADIR:

~$ CLASSPATH="$OB_JAVADIR/openbabel.jar" LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$OB_JAVADIR" scalac OBTest.scala
~$ CLASSPATH=".:$OB_JAVADIR/openbabel.jar" LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$OB_JAVADIR" scala OBTest
Loading openbabel_java...
Running OBTest...
