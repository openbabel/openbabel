.Sh NAME
.Nm obconformer
.Nd "generate conformer coordinates"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar #-of-conformers
.Ar #-of-optimization-steps
.Ar filename
.Ar [forcefield]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The obconformer tool can be used as part of a conformational study
by generating random conformers using a Monte Carlo search. The best
conformer out of the batch of conformers will be output, after
taking the supplied number of geometry optimization steps. By default,
obconformer uses the MMFF94 force field.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl "obconformer 250 100 baseconformer.sdf > rotamer1.sdf"
.Pp
Generate the best conformer (out of 250) of baseconformer.sdf and write
it to rotamer1.sdf after 100 geometry optimization steps
