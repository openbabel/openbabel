.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to generate Spectrophores, which are one-dimensional
descriptors generated from the property fields surrounding the molecules.
This technology allows the accurate description of molecules in terms of
their surface properties or fields. Comparison of molecules property fields
provides a robust structure-independent method of aligning actives from
different chemical classes. When applied to molecules such as ligands and
drugs, Spectrophores can be used as powerful molecular descriptors in the
fields of chemoinformatics, virtual screening, and QSAR modeling.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl i Ar file
Specifies the molecular input file from which Spectrophores are to be
calculated. The filetype is automatically detected from the file extension.
.It Fl n Ar value
Specifies the kind of normalization that should be performed. Valid values
are (without quotes): \fINo\fR (default), \fIZeroMean\fR, \fIUnitStd\fR and
\fIZeroMeanAndUnitStd\fR.
.It Fl a Ar value
Specifies the required accuracy expressed as the angular stepsize. Only the
following discrete values are allowed:
.Ar 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 No (default) | Ar 30 | 36 | 45 | 60
.It Fl s Ar value
Specifies the kind of cages that should be used in terms of the underlying
pointgroup: P1 or P-1. Valid values are (without quotes): \fINo\fR (default),
\fIUnique\fR, \fIMirror\fR and \fIAll\fR.
.It Fl r Ar value
Specifies the required resolution expressed as a real positive number. The
default value is \fI3.0\fR Angstrom. Negative values or a value equal
to 0 generate an error message.
.It Fl u
Display implementation details.
.It Fl h
Display help message.
