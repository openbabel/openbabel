.Sh NAME
.Nm obprobe
.Nd "create electrostatic probe grid"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar OPTIONS
.Ar type
.Ar pchg
.Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The obprobe tool creates a grid around a molecule, placing a probe
atom with a specified atom type and partial charge at each point to
calculate the MMFF94 energy. This can be used for docking experiments
to test hydrogen-bond affinity, electrostatic potential, etc.
Output is sent to standard output using the Gaussian Cube format.
.Sh OPTIONS
If no filename is given, obprobe will give all options including the
example probes.
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl s Ar stepsize
Set the resolution of the grid (stepsize)
.It Fl p Ar padding
Set the padding -- extra distance on each side of the box formed by
the molecule.
.It Ar type
MMFF94 atom type
.It Ar pchg
MMFF94 partial charge
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Probe the file pyridines.sdf using a carbonyl oxygen -- a hydrogen
bond acceptor with partial charge \-0.57:
.Dl "obprobe 7 \-0.57 pyridines.sdf"
.Pp
Probe the file pyridines.sdf using a phenyl carbon atom -- a
hydrophobic atom with no partial charge:
.Dl "obprobe 37 0.0 pyridines.sdf"
