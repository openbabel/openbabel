Open Babel THANKS
-------------------

Open Babel was largely written as OELib and Babel by Matt Stahl and
others. It would not be what it is without the help of a cast of many:

Michael Banck
Joe Corkery
Brian Goldman
Anthony Nicholls
Roger Sayle
Matt Stahl
Bob Tolbert
Pat Walters

There are probably many more who have contributed to Babel, OBabel,
OELib or directly to Open Babel who are not listed here. Please help
us keep this list updated. We'd ideally like to list a short
description of what people contributed. THANKS!
