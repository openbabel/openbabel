  /*! \class vector3 vector3.h <openbabel/math/vector3.h>
    \brief Represents a vector in 3-dimensional real space.

    The vector3 class was designed to simplify operations with floating
    point coordinates. To this end many of the common operations have been
    overloaded for simplicity. Vector addition, subtraction, scalar
    multiplication, dot product, cross product, magnitude and a number of
    other utility functions are built in to the vector class. For a full
    description of the class member functions please consult the
    documentation. The following code demonstrates several of the
    functions of the vector class:
    \code
    vector3 v1,v2,v3;
    v1 = VX;
    v2 = VY;
    v3 = cross(v1,v2);
    v3 *= 2.5;
    v3.normalize();
    \endcode
  */

  /*! This (slow) method allows one to access the elements of the
    vector as if it were an array of doubles. If the index is > 2,
    then a warning is printed and 0.0 is returned.
    Otherwise, if i is 0, 1 or 2, then a reference to x,
    y or z is returned, respectively.

    \warning This method is primarily designed to facilitate the
    integration ('Open Babelization') of code that uses arrays of
    doubles rather than the vector class. Due to the error checks
    the method is of course very slow and should therefore be
    avoided in production code.
