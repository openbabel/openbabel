2003-03-12  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/pdb.cpp (WritePDB): Make sure that atom type definitions are
	written correctly as per the PDB standard. Fixes PR#701620, as
	suggested by Christian Hofbauer.

	* src/report.cpp: Add support for listing torsion angles. Angle
	and torsion data is not the same as in Babel 1.6, but is
	coherent. Fixes feature request PR#568088.

2003-03-11  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/generic.h, src/generic.cpp: Add new OBUnitCell generic data
	type for storing and converting unit cell parameters.

	* test/Makefile.in, test/main.cpp, test/unitcell.cpp,
	test/unitcell.txt: New test to confirm that unit cell conversions
	occur accurately.

	* src/atom.cpp (GetAtomicMass): If an isotope has been set, use
	that as the atomic mass. Otherwise stick to the normal average
	mass.

	* src/isotope-small.txt, src/Makefile.in, src/isotope.h: Smaller
	set of isotopes for generating default data to minimize growth in
	executable size.

2003-03-10  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/generic.h: Add new data type "slots" to obDataType enum.

	* src/pdb.cc (class OBSerialNums): Use new obSerialNums enum,
	rather than overriding user-defined obData# slots. These should
	only be used by user-level code, not by Open Babel internal code.

2003-03-10  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/atom.cpp (GetType): Fix compilation error when copying in
	"D" atom type for a deuterium atom.

	* src/mol2.cpp (ReadMol2): Read residue information if available,
	along with atom IDs and residue number. Should address feature
	request PR#697614 submitted by Claudio Cavasotto.

	* src/mol.h, src/mol.cpp: Add API support for a molecular total
	charge.
	
2003-03-06  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/Makefile.in: Add support for the isotopes.txt -> .h
	conversion.

	* src/mol.h: Add support for storing atomic isotopes and
	"exact mass" methods.

	* src/mol.cpp (GetExactMass): New method, using isotope table.
	
	* src/atom.cpp: Add support for atomic isotopes, including
	modifications to SetType methods to ensure deuterium isotopes
	translate into the correct type.

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add new OBIsotopeTable for obtaining
	exact masses of given element/isotope combinations.
	(OBElementTable::GetAtomicNum): Expand to return isotope for the
	case where a "D" or "T" symbol is passed to the table.

	* src/isotope.txt, src/isotope.h: Update to include atomic numbers
	at the beginning of each line so ParseLine() knows "where it is."

	* src/report.cpp: Add output of molecular weight and exact mass.
	
2003-03-02  Geoffrey Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mopac.cpp (ReadMOPAC): Fix problems with MOPAC partial
	charges not translating to other formats. (PR#660364)

2003-02-28  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mol.h: Add new method OBAtom::SamllestBondAngle().

	* src/atom.cpp: Implement it.

	* src/mol.cpp (ConnectTheDots): Improve bonding by checking for
	small bond angles while removing long bonds.

	* src/pdb.cpp: Do not attempt to add alpha-peptide
	bonds. ConnectTheDots is much better at this and doesn't attempt
	to add strange very long-range bonds.

2003-01-17  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/base.cpp: Add introduction to documentation.

	* src/mol.cpp: Don't attempt to use Kekulize or Begin/EndModify to
	detect aromaticity.

	* src/phmodel.txt, src/phmodeldata.h: Add histidine transformation
	and unused tryptophan transformation to help with problems
	observed by Richard Gillian (PR#575964).

	* src/resdata.txt src/resdata.h: Fix incorrect bond orders for ARG
	residue. (PR#575964).

	* test/matrixtest.cpp: Make matrix test a bit more verbose to make
	debugging problems on non-Intel platforms easier. (Relates to
	PR#647417). Problem derives from numerical accuracy, but loosening
	tolerance to 2e-6 solves the problem.
	
2003-01-15/16  Peter Murray-Rust <pm286@cam.ac.uk>
               Vincent Favre-Nicolin <vincefn@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* Changes to compile using the free Borland C++ compiler 5.5.1:
	a few fixes ISO C++ fixes, some #if's and added makefiles (bc32.mak)

2003-01-06  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	Lots of changes from the last few weeks.

	* Doxyfile: Bump to 1.100.1. Make sure to check .cpp files for
	docs too.

	* Makefile.in (disclean): Remove doc/API for distclean target.

	* src/bin2hex.pl: Add comments to headers about contents
	(i.e. what the headers do, why they're not supposed to be installed).

	* src/chains.cpp: Fix mistake in Pyroglutamate comment from OE->OB
	find/replace.
	
	* src/aromatic.txt, src/atomtype.txt, src/element.txt,
	src/extable.txt, src/phmodel.txt, src/resdata.txt, src/types.txt:
	Updated comments at top of file to give more documentation and
	point to appropriate source files.
	
	* src/atom.cpp, src/base.h, src/bitvec.cpp, src/bitvec.h,
	src/bond.cpp, src/data.cpp, src/data.h, src/fileformat.h,
	src/generic.h, src/grid.h, src/mol.cpp, src/mol.cpp,
	src/molchrg.cpp, src/molchrg.h src/obutil.cpp, src/obutil.h,
	src/parsmart.cpp, src/parsmart.h, src/patty.cpp, src/patty.h,
	src/residue.cpp, src/ring.cpp, src/ring.h, src/rotor.h,
	src/typer.cpp, src/typer.h, src/math/matrix3x3.cpp,
	src/math/matrix3x3.h, src/math/vector3.cpp, src/math/vector3.h: 
	Updated Doxygen docs (brief comments in headers mostly, more
	detailed documentation if available in source files.)

	* src/mol.h, src/atom.cpp, src/bond.cpp, src/residue.cpp: Added
	support for OBGenericData stored in an OBAtom, OBBond or
	OBResidue.

	* src/isotope.txt, src/bond.txt: New data files, currently unused.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add new zindo target.

	* src/zindo.cpp: New ZINDO input support.

	* src/fileformat.cpp: Call WriteZindo for ZINDO file format.

2002-12-19  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/tinker.cpp: Add comment that we're using MM2 parameters.

	* src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBondOrders): Fix ugly bug causing crashes
	with -NO2 groups, reported by Richard Muller.

2002-12-6  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Doxyfile, README, configure.in, configure: Rename version to
	1.100.

	* doc/FAQ: Update with a few minor corrections -- synched with
	website.

	* THANKS: A few omissions -- synched with website.

	* src/mdl.cpp, src/smi.cpp: Throw errors if the molecules are too
	large, rather than segfault. In MDL, this seems to be a problem
	inherent in the file format. For SMI, this seems to be a recursion
	problem.

	* src/mol.cpp: Take out the "quick-and-dirty" aromatic pass, it's
	too rough to be useful. I need to figure out how to pass off the
	rough structure to the Kekulize routines.

	* src/types.txt, src/types.h: Make sure there's a default type for
	an "N" atom, caught by roundtrip testing from PDB files. Fix typo
	for O.co2 v. Oco2 external type. Also add XYZ forms for all atoms.

2002-12-5  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Doxyfile: Update for 1.99.1 release.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Make sure to remove autom4te.cache, etc.

	* THANKS: Plenty of contributors to this next release!

	* configure.in: When searching for the "ar" program, remember that
	Solaris has it in /usr/ccs/bin, so we should check there and fall
	back to the user's $PATH if it's not found.

	* configure: Regeneratre using autoconf-2.56.

	* src/mol.h: Add OBAtom::GetAtomicMass(), which will eventually
	allow for isotope-labeled atoms.

	* src/atom.cpp: Implement it.

	* src/mol.cpp (GetMolWt): Write using above.

	* src/cml.cpp: For the moment, turn off debugging output. (This
	should really go through a filter to allow users to see it if
	needed.)

	* src/data.cpp (GetAtomicNum): Have D and T atoms return for
	hydrogen. Eventually needs to support isotopes!

	* src/element.txt, src/element.h: Update with current IUPAC
	masses.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Make sure all extensions are
	lowercased--since all comparisons are done this way. Fixes bug
	with GROMOS96 translation.

	* src/fileformat.h, src/fileformat.cpp (ReadMolecule): Fix thinko
	with BGF format--call the proper procedue.
	(WriteMolecule): Write Box format with a default size. (!!)

	* src/bgf (ReadBGF): Cleanups found from roundtrip testing. Make
	sure bond records are parsed correctly and run atom types through
	the element table rather than the type table.
	(WriteBGF): Change remark to "Open Babel" rather than "Babel" so
	people know who created the bugs. ;-)

	* src/gromos96.cpp: Use "Open Babel" as above.

	* src/pdb.cpp (WriteDelphiPDB, WritePDB): Make sure we have a
	proper line length. Bug discovered via roundtrip testing (and our
	complaints about short CONECT lines).

	* src/povray.cpp: Don't attempt to get a hostname--this introduces
	all sorts of portability problems. Also use the atomic symbol
	rather than the atom type. Less flexible, but POV-Ray doesn't like
	some symbols in atom types (e.g. period in O.co2).

	* src/report.cpp: Add report on chiral atoms. (Probably needs some
	improvement still.)

	* src/types.h, src/types.txt: Add missing types, notably for Ar
	and B2, uncovered via roundtrip testing to the c3d file formats.

	* src/xed.cpp: Fix segfault caused by improper iteration over
	bonds. Uncovered via roundtrip testing.

2002-12-3  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/data.cpp (ParseLine): Fix bug that ignored the first
	non-comment line.

2002-12-2  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, src/math/Makefile.in,
	test/Makefile.in: Makefile changes to ensure the src/math
	directory is called for all targets (including "clean") and
	testing data files are only copied when needed for $(builddir) !=
	$(srcdir).

	* src/mol.h: Fix typo in OBMol documentation.

	* src/mol.cpp: Add quick-and-dirty aromatic marking.

2002-12-1  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/bond.txt: Data file for functional group recognition in bond
	order typing (currently unused).

	* src/*.txt: Update with headers, including copyright notice.

	* src/data.cpp: Ignore comment characters (including copyright
	notice).

	* src/pdb.cpp: Fix bug with reading in residue data--the source
	file is called resdata.txt, not residue.txt.

2002-11-28  Vincent Favre-Nicolin <vincefn@users.sf.net>

	* src/obutil.cpp(CartesianToInternal): Fix the conversion
	from cartesian to Internal coordinates. The previous code
	prevented atom 3 to be bonded with atom 1, and any
	atom with idx>3 to be bonded with atom 1 or 2, which does
	happen sometimes...

2002-11-27  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/atom.cpp(MemberOfRingSize): New method -- if atom is in a
	ring, return size. (Need to fix to designate *which* ring if in
	multiple.)
	(SetHybAndGeom): Fix to use scaled bondlengths for aromatic,
	double and triple bonds and adjust expected bond angles if in a
	ring.

	* src/mol.cpp: Add << and >> convenience functions based on
	OBFileFormat objects.

	* src/ghemical.cpp: Fix header line for new "gpr" extension.

	* src/povray.cpp: New file, contributed by Steffen Reith to output
	POV-Ray scene files.
	
	* src/data.cpp, src/data.h: Add POV file type.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Likewise.

	* src/fileformat.cpp, src/fileformat.h: Likewise:

	* src/Makefile.in: Add povray.cpp.

	* doc/README.dioxin.pov, doc/README.povray, doc/babel31.inc,
	doc/dioxin.mol2, doc/dioxin.pov: New files.

2002-11-25  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mol.cpp, src/mol.h: Add back << and >> convenience functions
	derived from OBFileFormat methods.
	(PerceiveBondOrders): Fix bug introduced with previous change--do
	not add multiple bonds to an atom already with them. (Causes a
	problem with allene, but this is a rarer situation than the
	reverse.)

	* src/pdb.cpp (WritePDB, WriteDelphiPDB): Fix ATOM records with
	correct specification. Should fix problems with 5-digit atom
	numbers, PR#633719, reported by Kristian Rother.
	
2002-11-20  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* configure: Update with new autoconf-2.56

	* src/Makefile.in, src/math/Makefile.in, test/Makefile.in: Remove
	redundant '/' in path for $(builddir) variable.

	* src/data.cpp: Remove references to depreciated strstream.h
	header.

	* src/data.h: Likewise.

	* src/mol.cpp: Add "flat ring" pass for 5-member and 6-member
	rings. Ensures that these are all marked as potential sp2
	hybrids. Also prevent adding 4 bonds to nitrogen, for now.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Update with new Ghemical
	extension .gpr (same format though).

2002-10-11  Michael Banck <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/math/Makefile.in: New file.

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.in: Adjust accordingly.

2002-09-19  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/aromatic.h, src/aromatic.txt: Remove selenium aromatic
	pattern for now. Fixes test/smartstest error on
	LABOTEST_LT-2_FE_546.

	* src/c3d.cpp, src/chains.cpp, src/cml.cpp, src/data.cpp,
	src/jaguar.cpp, src/main.cpp, src/mol.cpp, src/oberror.h,
	src/pdb.cpp, src/phmodel.cpp, src/ring.cpp, src/smi.cpp,
	src/xyz.cpp, src/math/matrix3x3.cpp, test/matrixtest.cpp,
	test/ringtest.cpp, test/smartstest.cpp: Warning fixes contributed
	by Erik Kruus.

2002-09-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/report.cpp: Fix bug noted by Markku Laukkanen, where the min
	variable would roll past the maximum number of atoms in a
	molecule.

	* src/cml.cpp (debugMolecule): Add default dimension. Contributed
	by Francesco Bresciani.

	* src/obutil.cpp (InternalToCartesian): If vector input is empty,
	quit early. Contributed by Francesco Bresciani.

	* src/oberror.h, src/oberror.cpp: Namespace fixes to handle
	problems on gcc-3.1 as reported by Austin Acton and Andrea Tasso.

2002-09-07  Michael Banck <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Replaced $DEST with $DESTDIR and $bindir

2002-08-30  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/math/matrix3x3.cpp, src/math/matrix3x3.h added methods, in
	particular for eigenvector calculations. Modified the API slightly. 
	* src/mol.cpp, src/obutil.cpp removed a couple of undocumented
	mathematical methods that were never used. Make mol use the 
	eigenvector functions from the matrix class now.	
	* test/matrixtest.cpp test suite for matrix algebra and eigenvector 
	calculations
	* src/oberror.cpp, src/oberror.h introduced a generic error class

2002-08-27  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/main.cpp, test/ringtest.cpp, test/smartstest.cpp resolved
	namespace problems for the tests. The test compile now, but show
	errors.

2002-08-25  Michael Banck <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Changed charge to int (gaussian.cpp) and divisor/exponent to 
	double (c3d.cpp) in order to compile on g++-3.2

2002-08-19  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/xyz.cpp more bugfixing. The translator behaves now smarter
	when interpreting the title and the atom types.

2002-08-16  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/pdb.cpp re-wrote routine to read CONECT records. That
	(hopefully) fixes a number of bugs in the earlier version
	(inability to read 5-digit serial numbers, accidently reading salt
	bridges as connects, etc.)

2002-08-15  Geoff Hutchison <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/pdb.cc: Fix ParseConectRecord to make sure we don't read
	beyond the vs.size().


2002-08-14  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/xyz.cpp Set molecule title to the string that is read from
	the second line of the file. Set atom type strings to strings read
	from the file. The reading method now prints +extensive+ and
	+detailed+ warnings to cerr if is xyz file is bad.

2002-07-26  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/math/matrix3x3.cpp added a few method useful in symmetry
	detection

2002-07-30  Michael Banck <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/gaussian.cpp: Last atom was written twice

2002-07-26  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* added documentation

2002-07-24  Michael Banck <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/gaussian.cpp: Added some comments/warnings; changed multiplicity
	calculation to use abs(charge) instead of charge
	* src/Makefile.in: splitted CXXFLAGS into CXXFLAGS, DEFS and INCS

2002-07-22  Michael Banck <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/gaussian.cpp: Fixed WriteGaussianCart() hopefully:
	- calculate charge and mulitiplicty (the latter being quite shakey
	  ATM)
	- do away with the zero after the atom type
	- don't reference coordinates, write them straight after the atom type
	- add a blank line at the end
	* configure.in: Added --enable-doxygen configure option. If enabled,
	search for doxygen and print an URL if not found
	* configure: Updated for new configure.in

2002-07-18  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* isolated the 3-dimensional vector and matrix classes, gave them
	less ambigous names, and put them into a directory "math". Added
	an access function to the vector class.

2002-07-12  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* added documentation to the Vector class, made some functions
	inline, and commented out some methods of the vector class
	whose names I found misleading, and which were never used anyway.

	* src/Vector.cpp, src/Vector.h: added documentation to the Vector
	class, made some functions inline, and commented out some methods
	of the vector class whose names I found misleading, and which were
	never used anyway.
	
	* configure.in: configure now warns if doxygen is not present

	* configure: Updated with autoconf 2.52d.

2002-07-09  Geoff Hutchison <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/fileformat.h, src/mol.h, src/binary.h: Fix missing std:: in
	headers, which causes problems with namespace-compliant
	compilers. Should fix PR #578522.

	* src/residue.cpp: Add missing "using namespace std," which also
	caused problems with namespace-compliant compilers.

	* src/pdb.cpp: For now, disable bond order perception--prevents
	problems with PDB residues observed by Richard Gillian.

2002-07-01  Richard Gillian <reg8@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/main.cpp: Add -hpH to use the "adjust pH" setting for adding
	hydrogens.

	* src/mol.cpp: When adding hydrogens, if the parent atom is part
	of a residue, copy this information to the new atoms.

	* src/mol2.cpp: Write residue types and original atom names for
	the atoms if they exist.

2002-07-01  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Doxyfile: New file, configuration for Doxygen API documentation.

	* configure: Updated with autoconf 2.52d.

	* Makefile.in: Added automatic API documentation generation. Use
	"make apidoc".

2002-06-29  Vincent Favre-Nicolin <vincefn@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mol.h: Give sample documentation from the primer for
	OBResidue, OBAtom and OBMol.

	* src/ring.h: As above for the OBRing class.

2002-06-28  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* configure.in, configure, src/Makefile.in: Adjust for various
	removed (unused) files.

	* src/fileformat.cpp, src/fileformat.h: Use a const char * title
	and declare ReadMolecule and WriteMolecule methods static to allow
	calling w/o needing to instantiate a specific OBFileFormat object.
	
	* src/*.cpp: Adjust all ReadFile methods to use const char* title,
	as above.

	* src/atom.cpp, src/binary.cpp, src/binary.h: Fixes imported from
	OELib.

	* src/generic.cpp, src/generic.h: Add support for torsion and
	angle data and associated handlers for OBGenericData.

	* src/main.cpp: Remove obsolete headers.

	* src/mol.cpp, src/mol.h: Add OBMol::FindTorsions method to fill
	the OBTorsionData in a molecule. Remove the confusing OBPose
	class. (Conformers are conformers and not managed by a separate
	class.) Remove residue code, which has migrated to residue.cpp.

	* src/obutil.cpp: Remove unused code.

	* src/pdb.cpp: Add OBSerialNums, imported from OELib.

2002-06-11  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/Makefile.in: Add proper commandline for new bin2hex for
	PhModelData. Remove smarts.* from file lists.

	* src/Vector.cpp: Import changes contributed by Open
	Eye--improvements in random vector and matrix methods.

	* src/*.h: Improve top comment to refer to Open Babel and update
	copyright dates. Add uniform #ifdef symbols to prevent clashing
	with external header files.

	* src/alchemy.cpp, src/atom.cpp, src/balst.cpp, src/chains.cpp:
	Updates to cut down on buffer overflows, to begin addressing
	PR#565413.

	* src/data.cpp: Make OBExtensionTable types uniform. Make sure
	\0 is inserted in the proper place in the buffer when reading from
	the dataptr in OBGlobalDataBase::Init(). Fixes PR#567420.

	* src/fileformat.cpp: Use updated io_type declarations.

	* src/types.txt: Reformat to remove trailing whitespace and make
	spacing uniform. (Attempt to minimize problems with reading using
	OBTypeTable.)

	* src/obutil.[h,cpp]: Remove SmartsLexReplace, which is now
	migrated to parsmart.[h,cpp].

	* src/parsmart.[h,cpp]: Updated version from code contributed by
	Open Eye. Includes caching and RestrictedMatch method and seems to
	solve memory leak problems in older version. Solves PR#536943 and
	#564096. Includes code from smarts.* files.
	
	* src/phmodel.cpp: Update to work with new SMARTS parser.

2002-06-07  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Make sure directories are properly created on "make
	install" which fixes PR#565412.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add support for rebuilding the binary data
	headers when needed. Also generates library first, then just links
	this into main.o for the program. Also as above.

	* src/bin2hex.pl: Import a revised version contributed by Open
	Eye.

	* src/atomtyp.txt, src/extable.txt, src/types.txt: Ditto.

	* src/aromatic.h, src/atomtyp.h, src/element.h, src/extable.h,
	src/phmodel.h, src/resdata.h, src/types.h: Generate using new
	bin2hex.pl.

2002-06-06  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for -iMIME or -oMIME <mime_type>
	input. This should facilitate use for web applications (e.g. as a
	pass-through filter to other programs).

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add methods
	IsReadable/IsWritable(io_type).

2002-05-30  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mol.h, src/atom.cpp (HasNonSingleBond): Add new method to
	simplify and optimize bond typing code.

	* src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBondOrders): Use it.

	* src/cml.cpp: Fix problems with arrays of OBAtom* since these
	cause casting problems in ISO C++. Still has a number of "missing
	return" warnings, though these shouldn't cause problems.

2002-04-23  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/hin.cpp (ReadHIN): Fix bugs in reading HyperChem files as
	contributed by Tommi Hassinen.

2002-04-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/qchem.cpp: Fix conversion from internal coordinates at the
	end of a geometry optimization (silly thinko, forgot to convert
	from deg. to rad. for angles).

2002-04-12  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/bin2hex.pl: Set output header files to be "static const
	char" instead of plain char. Should prevent some clobbering,
	e.g. PR #543314.

	* src/aromatic.h, src/atomtyp.h, src/element.h, src/extable.h,
	src/phmodeldata.h, src/resdata.h, src/types.h: Generate as above.

	* src/aromatic.txt, src/atomtyp.txt, src/phmodel.txt: Change
	"OELib" in headers to "Open Babel."

	* src/data.h: Make all _dataptr members "const char" and set
	ParseLine() methods to operate on const char*.

	* src/data.cpp, src/pdb.cpp, src/phmodel.cpp, src/rotor.cpp,
	src/typer.cpp: As above.

	* src/mol.h: Set tokenize() declarations to operate on const
	char*.

	* src/tokenst.cpp: As above.

2002-04-05  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/parsmart.cpp: Added some defensive programming when calling
	delete, also set the pointer to NULL.

	* src/parsmart.h: Add constructor and destructor to
	OBSmartsParser.

	* src/smarts.h: Add full destructors for OBEdge, OBNode.

	* src/smarts.cpp: As above. Should solve memory leaks, PR #508056.
	
2002-03-30  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/*.h: Update headers to use std:: namespace to refer to
	vectors, strings, pairs, streams, etc.

	* src/*.cpp: As a first stage in full namespace support, add a
	full "using namespace std;" (to be followed eventually with only
	importing the necessary namespace portions.
	
2002-03-27  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/cml.cpp: Fix use of strcmp() in code in favor of strncmp()
	to prevent buffer overflow. Fixes problems with 2D/3D export.
	
2002-03-26  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/cml.cpp: New CML support, including built-in XML parser,
	contributed by Peter Murray-Rust.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add cml.cpp to list to support CML compilation.

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add CML file type.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Update to add in .cml files.

	read/write as well as passing options to WriteMolecule methods.

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for passing output options (currently
	only XML/CML) to export methods.
	
	* src/aromatic.txt: Enable support for recognizing Se in aromatic
	rings. (Uncommon, but I've been doing work with selenophene
	recently.)

	* src/pdb.cpp (ParseConectRecord): Fix bugs in CONECT records with
	PDB files. Would only read first 4 columns and wouldn't handle
	multiple bonds. Fixes PR #529744. Use PerceiveBondOrders() when
	using ConnectTheDots() for missing bonds.
	
	* src/ghemical.cpp: Add error checking for reading bonds. Don't
	assume the # of bonds given in the header is correct.

	* src/mol.cpp: Check to see if a bond exists before adding
	it. (Prevents a bond addition (a,b) followed by (b,a).)

2002-02-22  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/Makefile.in: Add viewmol.o.

	* src/viewmol.cpp: New code to read/write ViewMol files as ported
	from the GPL'ed patch sent by J?rg-R?diger Hill.

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp, src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Add
	ViewMol format and enable Chem3D and derived formats.

	* src/c3d.cpp: Clean up Read methods to match normal declarations.

	* src/fileformat.h, src/fileformat.cpp: Enable Read/Write for
	Chem3d1, Chem3d2, Mmads and ViewMol formats.

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for using '--' to read from STDIN and
	output to STDOUT. Tackles request #519085.
	
2002-02-17  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* README, configure.in, configure: Update for next snapshot of
	1.99.1.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add -I(builddir) to ensure that
	configure-generated version.h is included.

	* src/alchemy.cpp, src/amber.cpp, src/balst.cpp, src/box.cpp,
	src/cacao.cpp, src/car.cpp, src/ccc.cpp, src/dmol.cpp,
	src/feat.cpp, src/gamess.cpp, src/gaussian.cpp, src/hin.cpp,
	src/jaguar.cpp, src/mopac.cpp, src/mpqc.cpp, src/nwchem.cpp,
	src/qchem.cpp, src/report.cpp, src/unichem.cpp, src/xyz.cpp:
	Make sure that SetTitle() is called with the default title if the
	format doesn't have a title, do not set atom types unless the
	format supports them (the internal atom typer is better), and for
	formats without bond information, call the new
	mol.PerceiveBondOrders() method.

	* src/mol.h, src/mol.cpp: Rename PerceiveBonds in favor of
	more accurate PerceiveBondOrders(). Make sure that
	auto-hybridization is turned off while bond orders are being
	perceived and then let it run afterwards.
	
2002-02-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBonds): Improve accuracy by picking the
	closer atom (shorter bond) when there are two atoms with equal
	electronegativities.

	* src/main.cpp: Add -v flag to give version information but not
	the whole usage report.
	
	* src/base.h, src/binary_io.h, src/bitvec.h, src/commandline.h,
	src/ctransform.h, src/data.h, src/fileformat.h, src/grid.h,
	src/matrix.h, src/mol.h, src/obutil.h, src/smarts.h: Remove
	"using" statements from header files which pollute namespace of
	user code. Fixes PR#493388.

2002-02-14  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add MIME support to
	OBExtensionTable. Progress towards feature request #511533.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: As above (using as much from the
	current Chemical MIME page as possible).

	* src/mol.h, src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBonds): Add preliminary support
	for assigning bond orders based on Roger Sayle's "Cruft to
	Content" algorithm. Still needs functional group and aromatic ring
	recognition passes. Progress towards feature request #514589.
	<http://www.daylight.com/meetings/mug01/Sayle/m4xbondage.html>

	* src/mopac.cc: Fix bugs in read/write methods as pointed out by
	Radek Liboska. Should solve PR #515884.

	* src/atom.cpp (GetType): Fix bug with atom typing by assigning
	the ATN type of an atom if the atom typer didn't pick one before.

	* src/gamess.cpp, src/xyz.cpp, src/unichem.cpp, src/ghemical.cpp:
	Don't try to translate atom types as this causes problems. (Works
	cleanly now that the GetType() bug is fixed.)
	
2002-02-13  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/data.cpp, src/data.h, src/element.txt: Added support for
	electronegativity of elements. (Needed for assigning bond types,
	among other things.)

	* src/element.h: Regenerate using bin2hex.pl.

	* src/ghemical.cpp: Don't try to type atoms, it only causes
	problems with the internal atom typing.

2002-02-07  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>
	
	* src/Makefile.in: Add c3d.cpp to the compilation list.

	* src/obutil.cpp: Migrate quat.c code here temporarily.
	
	* src/mol.cpp, src/mol.h: Resolve problems with declarations of
	old quat.c code since they now fall under OpenBabel namespace.

2002-02-01  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* test/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Delete Makefile when calling
	distclean target.

	* Makefile.in: Fix install target to create the $(mandir) directory.

2002-02-01  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Added manpage to install target.

	* configure, configure.in, Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	src/version.h.in: Put version information in configure.in and made
	generated tarballs contain it.
	
2002-01-24  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* doc/FAQ, doc/babel.1: Minor documentation fixes.
	
2002-01-21  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Fix problems with the dist target.

	* configure, configure.in: Add 'top_builddir' macro to know where
	objdir is in the case that we're not building in the source
	directory.

	* src/Makefile.in: Run the library through 'ranlib', which fixes
	problems on Mac OS X. Fix problems running 'install' when not
	building in the source directory.

	* src/unichem.cpp: Fix bug in reading files.

	* src/version.h: Set version to 1.99.
	
	* test/Makefile.in: Fix problems with the check target: tests need
	to be copied to the build dir if we're not in the source directory.
	
2002-01-21  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* doc/*: Move documentation to subdirectory--since there will
	eventually be more than these few morsels.

	* doc/Migration: Add a Migration guide for OELib -> Open Babel changes.

2002-01-20  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* FAQ, README: Added FAQ.

2002-01-20  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>	

	* babel.1: Initial import of man page, this is only a rough
	draft. Should become babel.1.in perhaps, with the available file
	types determined during the build.

2002-01-18  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>	

        * Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Fixed install target. Removed
	Primer.html, bin2hex.pl and GNULICENSE from datafiles. Added
	datafiles to install: target.

        * Makefile.in, src/data.cpp, src/Makefile.in, src/patty.cpp,
	src/pdb.cpp, src/phmodel.cpp, src/rotor.cpp, src/typer.cpp:
        Openbabel now first checks for $BABEL_DATADIR, then looks in
	${pkgdatadir} and finally uses the compiled-in values to get the
	relevant data.
	
2002-01-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/main.cpp: Use the filename as the default filename when
	reading molecules.

	* src/qchem.cpp: Disable reading final z-matrix--currently
	produces very bizzare results for some files.

	* test/Makefile.in: Make sure the main program is compiled too.

	* test/main.cpp, test/ringtest.cpp, test/smartstest.cpp: Update to
	new OpenBabel API. (Took about a minute to change OE->OB and
	change to iterate over OBNodeBase and OBEdgeBase.)

	* test/smartstest.txt: Get rid of DOS line endings--lines are not
	properly read.

2002-01-11  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/Makefile.in, test/Makefile.in, Makefile.in: Added
	distclean-targets to src and test's Makefiles and removed stamp.h
	again (D'OH).

	* Makefile.in: Added 'stamp.h' to distclean:-target and renamed
	DISTDIR from *openbabel to *openbabel-dist.  ('make dist' fried my
	CVS-repository because it was named 'openbabel') dist:-target
	still does not work properly.
	Removed "\" at the end of first line of distclean:-target

2002-01-09  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* */*: Updated build environment with src/ directory and autoconf
	configure script. Builds cleanly--haven't tried using the "install
	target" The test/ subdir needs fixing to remove OELib references.

2001-12-14  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Changed oeutil.* to the new name obutil.*.

2001-12-14  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* */*: Changed OE prefix to OB -- think I got all the cases, but
	some may crop up.

	Thanks to Michael Banck:
	-Added some GNUish files like AUTHORS, etc.
	-Added configure.in -- will shortly replace configure script with
	an autoconf one. 
	-Need to decide how to work ChangeLog--should it go before
	OELib->OpenBabel change?

	* */*: Many changes to namespace and cleanup of API to work with
	gcc v. 3. Still need to do big OE prefix cleanup.

2001-11-28  ghutchis  <ghutchis@hydra.chem.northwestern.edu>

	* configure, data.cpp, dmol.cpp, main.cpp, mol.cpp, Primer.html,
	Makefile.in: Fixes from Ghemical and a first start at the "Open
	Babel" nomenclature.

2001-11-27  ghutchis  <ghutchis@hydra.chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Import from OE current CVS. (Last GPL'ed version.)
