2002-07-12  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Vector.cpp, src/Vector.h: added documentation to the Vector
	class, made some functions inline, and commented out some methods
	of the vector class whose names I found misleading, and which were
	never used anyway.
	
	* configure.in: configure now warns if doxygen is not present

	* configure: Updated with autoconf 2.52d.

2002-07-09  Geoff Hutchison <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/fileformat.h, src/mol.h, src/binary.h: Fix missing std:: in
	headers, which causes problems with namespace-compliant
	compilers. Should fix PR #578522.

	* src/residue.cpp: Add missing "using namespace std," which also
	caused problems with namespace-compliant compilers.

	* src/pdb.cpp: For now, disable bond order perception--prevents
	problems with PDB residues observed by Richard Gillian.

2002-07-01  Richard Gillian <reg8@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/main.cpp: Add -hpH to use the "adjust pH" setting for adding
	hydrogens.

	* src/mol.cpp: When adding hydrogens, if the parent atom is part
	of a residue, copy this information to the new atoms.

	* src/mol2.cpp: Write residue types and original atom names for
	the atoms if they exist.

2002-07-01  Stefan Kebekus <kebekus@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Doxyfile: New file, configuration for Doxygen API documentation.

	* configure: Updated with autoconf 2.52d.

2002-06-28  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* configure.in, configure, src/Makefile.in: Adjust for various
	removed (unused) files.

	* src/fileformat.cpp, src/fileformat.h: Use a const char * title
	and declare ReadMolecule and WriteMolecule methods static to allow
	calling w/o needing to instantiate a specific OBFileFormat object.
	
	* src/*.cpp: Adjust all ReadFile methods to use const char* title,
	as above.

	* src/atom.cpp, src/binary.cpp, src/binary.h: Fixes imported from
	OELib.

	* src/mol.cpp, src/mol.h: Add OBMol::FindTorsions method to fill
	the OBTorsionData in a molecule. Remove the confusing OBPose
	class. (Conformers are conformers and not managed by a separate
	class.) Remove residue code, which has migrated to residue.cpp.

	* src/obutil.cpp: Remove unused code.

	* src/pdb.cpp: Add OBSerialNums, imported from OELib.

2002-06-11  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/Makefile.in: Add proper commandline for new bin2hex for
	PhModelData. Remove smarts.* from file lists.

	* src/Vector.cpp: Import changes contributed by Open
	Eye--improvements in random vector and matrix methods.

	* src/*.h: Improve top comment to refer to Open Babel and update
	copyright dates. Add uniform #ifdef symbols to prevent clashing
	with external header files.

	* src/alchemy.cpp, src/atom.cpp, src/balst.cpp, src/chains.cpp:
	Updates to cut down on buffer overflows, to begin addressing
	PR#565413.

	* src/data.cpp: Make OBExtensionTable types uniform. Make sure
	\0 is inserted in the proper place in the buffer when reading from
	the dataptr in OBGlobalDataBase::Init(). Fixes PR#567420.

	* src/fileformat.cpp: Use updated io_type declarations.

	* src/types.txt: Reformat to remove trailing whitespace and make
	spacing uniform. (Attempt to minimize problems with reading using
	OBTypeTable.)

	* src/obutil.[h,cpp]: Remove SmartsLexReplace, which is now
	migrated to parsmart.[h,cpp].

	* src/parsmart.[h,cpp]: Updated version from code contributed by
	Open Eye. Includes caching and RestrictedMatch method and seems to
	solve memory leak problems in older version. Solves PR#536943 and
	#564096. Includes code from smarts.* files.
	
	* src/phmodel.cpp: Update to work with new SMARTS parser.

2002-06-07  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Make sure directories are properly created on "make
	install" which fixes PR#565412.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add support for rebuilding the binary data
	headers when needed. Also generates library first, then just links
	this into main.o for the program. Also as above.

	* src/bin2hex.pl: Import a revised version contributed by Open
	Eye.

	* src/atomtyp.txt, src/extable.txt, src/types.txt: Ditto.

	* src/aromatic.h, src/atomtyp.h, src/element.h, src/extable.h,
	src/phmodel.h, src/resdata.h, src/types.h: Generate using new
	bin2hex.pl.

2002-06-06  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for -iMIME or -oMIME <mime_type>
	input. This should facilitate use for web applications (e.g. as a
	pass-through filter to other programs).

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add methods
	IsReadable/IsWritable(io_type).

2002-05-30  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mol.h, src/atom.cpp (HasNonSingleBond): Add new method to
	simplify and optimize bond typing code.

	* src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBondOrders): Use it.

	* src/cml.cpp: Fix problems with arrays of OBAtom* since these
	cause casting problems in ISO C++. Still has a number of "missing
	return" warnings, though these shouldn't cause problems.

2002-04-23  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/hin.cpp (ReadHIN): Fix bugs in reading HyperChem files as
	contributed by Tommi Hassinen.

2002-04-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/qchem.cpp: Fix conversion from internal coordinates at the
	end of a geometry optimization (silly thinko, forgot to convert
	from deg. to rad. for angles).

2002-04-12  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/bin2hex.pl: Set output header files to be "static const
	char" instead of plain char. Should prevent some clobbering,
	e.g. PR #543314.

	* src/aromatic.h, src/atomtyp.h, src/element.h, src/extable.h,
	src/phmodeldata.h, src/resdata.h, src/types.h: Generate as above.

	* src/aromatic.txt, src/atomtyp.txt, src/phmodel.txt: Change
	"OELib" in headers to "Open Babel."

	* src/data.h: Make all _dataptr members "const char" and set
	ParseLine() methods to operate on const char*.

	* src/data.cpp, src/pdb.cpp, src/phmodel.cpp, src/rotor.cpp,
	src/typer.cpp: As above.

	* src/mol.h: Set tokenize() declarations to operate on const
	char*.

	* src/tokenst.cpp: As above.

2002-04-05  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	delete, also set the pointer to NULL.

	* src/parsmart.h: Add constructor and destructor to
	OBSmartsParser.

	* src/smarts.h: Add full destructors for OBEdge, OBNode.

	* src/smarts.cpp: As above. Should solve memory leaks, PR #508056.
	
2002-03-30  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/*.h: Update headers to use std:: namespace to refer to
	vectors, strings, pairs, streams, etc.

	* src/*.cpp: As a first stage in full namespace support, add a
	full "using namespace std;" (to be followed eventually with only
	importing the necessary namespace portions.
	
2002-03-27  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/cml.cpp: Fix use of strcmp() in code in favor of strncmp()
	to prevent buffer overflow. Fixes problems with 2D/3D export.
	
2002-03-26  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/cml.cpp: New CML support, including built-in XML parser,
	contributed by Peter Murray-Rust.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add cml.cpp to list to support CML compilation.

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add CML file type.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Update to add in .cml files.

	* src.fileformat.cpp, src/fileformat.h: Add in support for CML
	read/write as well as passing options to WriteMolecule methods.

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for passing output options (currently
	only XML/CML) to export methods.
	
	* src/aromatic.txt: Enable support for recognizing Se in aromatic
	rings. (Uncommon, but I've been doing work with selenophene
	recently.)

	* src/pdb.cpp (ParseConectRecord): Fix bugs in CONECT records with
	PDB files. Would only read first 4 columns and wouldn't handle
	multiple bonds. Fixes PR #529744. Use PerceiveBondOrders() when
	using ConnectTheDots() for missing bonds.
	
	* src/ghemical.cpp: Add error checking for reading bonds. Don't
	assume the # of bonds given in the header is correct.

	* src/mol.cpp: Check to see if a bond exists before adding
	it. (Prevents a bond addition (a,b) followed by (b,a).)

2002-02-22  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/Makefile.in: Add viewmol.o.

	* src/viewmol.cpp: New code to read/write ViewMol files as ported
	from the GPL'ed patch sent by J?rg-R?diger Hill.

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp, src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: Add
	ViewMol format and enable Chem3D and derived formats.

	* src/c3d.cpp: Clean up Read methods to match normal declarations.

	* src/fileformat.h, src/fileformat.cpp: Enable Read/Write for
	Chem3d1, Chem3d2, Mmads and ViewMol formats.

	* src/main.cpp: Add support for using '--' to read from STDIN and
	output to STDOUT. Tackles request #519085.
	
2002-02-17  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* README, configure.in, configure: Update for next snapshot of
	1.99.1.

	* src/Makefile.in: Add -I(builddir) to ensure that
	configure-generated version.h is included.

	* src/alchemy.cpp, src/amber.cpp, src/balst.cpp, src/box.cpp,
	src/cacao.cpp, src/car.cpp, src/ccc.cpp, src/dmol.cpp,
	src/feat.cpp, src/gamess.cpp, src/gaussian.cpp, src/hin.cpp,
	src/jaguar.cpp, src/mopac.cpp, src/mpqc.cpp, src/nwchem.cpp,
	src/qchem.cpp, src/report.cpp, src/unichem.cpp, src/xyz.cpp:
	Make sure that SetTitle() is called with the default title if the
	format doesn't have a title, do not set atom types unless the
	format supports them (the internal atom typer is better), and for
	formats without bond information, call the new
	mol.PerceiveBondOrders() method.

	* src/mol.h, src/mol.cpp: Rename PerceiveBonds in favor of
	more accurate PerceiveBondOrders(). Make sure that
	auto-hybridization is turned off while bond orders are being
	perceived and then let it run afterwards.
	
2002-02-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBonds): Improve accuracy by picking the
	closer atom (shorter bond) when there are two atoms with equal
	electronegativities.

	* src/main.cpp: Add -v flag to give version information but not
	the whole usage report.
	
	* src/base.h, src/binary_io.h, src/bitvec.h, src/commandline.h,
	src/ctransform.h, src/data.h, src/fileformat.h, src/grid.h,
	src/matrix.h, src/mol.h, src/obutil.h, src/smarts.h: Remove
	"using" statements from header files which pollute namespace of
	user code. Fixes PR#493388.

2002-02-14  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/data.h, src/data.cpp: Add MIME support to
	OBExtensionTable. Progress towards feature request #511533.

	* src/extable.txt, src/extable.h: As above (using as much from the
	current Chemical MIME page as possible).

	* src/mol.h, src/mol.cpp (PerceiveBonds): Add preliminary support
	for assigning bond orders based on Roger Sayle's "Cruft to
	Content" algorithm. Still needs functional group and aromatic ring
	recognition passes. Progress towards feature request #514589.
	<http://www.daylight.com/meetings/mug01/Sayle/m4xbondage.html>

	* src/mopac.cc: Fix bugs in read/write methods as pointed out by
	Radek Liboska. Should solve PR #515884.

	* src/atom.cpp (GetType): Fix bug with atom typing by assigning
	the ATN type of an atom if the atom typer didn't pick one before.

	* src/gamess.cpp, src/xyz.cpp, src/unichem.cpp, src/ghemical.cpp:
	Don't try to translate atom types as this causes problems. (Works
	cleanly now that the GetType() bug is fixed.)
	
2002-02-13  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/data.cpp, src/data.h, src/element.txt: Added support for
	electronegativity of elements. (Needed for assigning bond types,
	among other things.)

	* src/element.h: Regenerate using bin2hex.pl.

	* src/ghemical.cpp: Don't try to type atoms, it only causes
	problems with the internal atom typing.

2002-02-07  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>
	
	* src/Makefile.in: Add c3d.cpp to the compilation list.

	* src/obutil.cpp: Migrate quat.c code here temporarily.
	
	* src/mol.cpp, src/mol.h: Resolve problems with declarations of
	old quat.c code since they now fall under OpenBabel namespace.

2002-02-01  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* test/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Delete Makefile when calling
	distclean target.

	* Makefile.in: Fix install target to create the $(mandir) directory.

2002-02-01  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Added manpage to install target.

	* configure, configure.in, Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in,
	src/version.h.in: Put version information in configure.in and made
	generated tarballs contain it.
	
2002-01-24  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* doc/FAQ, doc/babel.1: Minor documentation fixes.
	
2002-01-21  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Fix problems with the dist target.

	* configure, configure.in: Add 'top_builddir' macro to know where
	objdir is in the case that we're not building in the source
	directory.

	* src/Makefile.in: Run the library through 'ranlib', which fixes
	problems on Mac OS X. Fix problems running 'install' when not
	building in the source directory.

	* src/unichem.cpp: Fix bug in reading files.

	* src/version.h: Set version to 1.99.
	
	* test/Makefile.in: Fix problems with the check target: tests need
	to be copied to the build dir if we're not in the source directory.
	
2002-01-21  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* doc/*: Move documentation to subdirectory--since there will
	eventually be more than these few morsels.

	* doc/Migration: Add a Migration guide for OELib -> Open Babel changes.

2002-01-20  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* FAQ, README: Added FAQ.

2002-01-20  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>	

	* babel.1: Initial import of man page, this is only a rough
	draft. Should become babel.1.in perhaps, with the available file
	types determined during the build.

2002-01-18  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>	

        * Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: Fixed install target. Removed
	Primer.html, bin2hex.pl and GNULICENSE from datafiles. Added
	datafiles to install: target.

        * Makefile.in, src/data.cpp, src/Makefile.in, src/patty.cpp,
	src/pdb.cpp, src/phmodel.cpp, src/rotor.cpp, src/typer.cpp:
        Openbabel now first checks for $BABEL_DATADIR, then looks in
	${pkgdatadir} and finally uses the compiled-in values to get the
	relevant data.
	
2002-01-16  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* src/main.cpp: Use the filename as the default filename when
	reading molecules.

	* src/qchem.cpp: Disable reading final z-matrix--currently
	produces very bizzare results for some files.

	* test/Makefile.in: Make sure the main program is compiled too.

	* test/main.cpp, test/ringtest.cpp, test/smartstest.cpp: Update to
	new OpenBabel API. (Took about a minute to change OE->OB and
	change to iterate over OBNodeBase and OBEdgeBase.)

	* test/smartstest.txt: Get rid of DOS line endings--lines are not
	properly read.

2002-01-11  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* src/Makefile.in, test/Makefile.in, Makefile.in: Added
	distclean-targets to src and test's Makefiles and removed stamp.h
	again (D'OH).

	* Makefile.in: Added 'stamp.h' to distclean:-target and renamed
	DISTDIR from *openbabel to *openbabel-dist.  ('make dist' fried my
	CVS-repository because it was named 'openbabel') dist:-target
	still does not work properly.
	Removed "\" at the end of first line of distclean:-target

2002-01-09  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* */*: Updated build environment with src/ directory and autoconf
	configure script. Builds cleanly--haven't tried using the "install
	target" The test/ subdir needs fixing to remove OELib references.

2001-12-14  Michael Banck  <mbanck@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Changed oeutil.* to the new name obutil.*.

2001-12-14  Geoff Hutchison  <hutchisn@chem.northwestern.edu>

	* */*: Changed OE prefix to OB -- think I got all the cases, but
	some may crop up.

	Thanks to Michael Banck:
	-Added some GNUish files like AUTHORS, etc.
	-Added configure.in -- will shortly replace configure script with
	an autoconf one. 
	-Need to decide how to work ChangeLog--should it go before
	OELib->OpenBabel change?

	* */*: Many changes to namespace and cleanup of API to work with
	gcc v. 3. Still need to do big OE prefix cleanup.

2001-11-28  ghutchis  <ghutchis@hydra.chem.northwestern.edu>

	* configure, data.cpp, dmol.cpp, main.cpp, mol.cpp, Primer.html,
	Makefile.in: Fixes from Ghemical and a first start at the "Open
	Babel" nomenclature.

2001-11-27  ghutchis  <ghutchis@hydra.chem.northwestern.edu>

	* Import from OE current CVS. (Last GPL'ed version.)
